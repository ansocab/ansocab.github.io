          Neapolitan pizza (Italian: pizza napoletana) also known as
          Naples-style pizza, is a style of pizza made with tomatoes and
          mozzarella cheese. It must be made with either San Marzano tomatoes or
          Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio, which grow on the volcanic plains
          to the south of Mount Vesuvius, and Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, a
          protected designation of origin cheese made with the milk from water
          buffalo raised in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio in a semi-wild
          state, or “Fior di Latte di Agerola”, a cow milk mozzarella made
          exclusively in the Agerola comune. Neapolitan pizza is a Traditional
          Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) product in Europe, and the art of its
          making is included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.
          This style of pizza gave rise to the New York-style pizza that was
          first made by Italian immigrants to the United States in the early
          20th century.

          Neapolitan is a Romance language of the Italo-Dalmatian group spoken
          across much of southern Italy, except for southern Calabria, southern
          Apulia, and Sicily, and spoken in a small part of central Italy (the
          province of Ascoli Piceno in the Marche). It is named after the
          Kingdom of Naples that once covered most of the area, of which the
          city of Naples was the capital. On October 14, 2008, a law by the
          Region of Campania stated that Neapolitan was to be protected.

          While the term "Neapolitan language" is used in this article to refer
          to the language group of related dialects found in southern
          continental Italy, it may also refer more specifically to the dialect
          of the Neapolitan language spoken in the Naples area or in Campania.
          In fact, in a colloquial or non-academic or non-linguist context,
          “Neapolitan language”, napulitano, or napoletano generally refers
          specifically to the variety of the language spoken in Naples and the
          surrounding area; however, this variety is usually mutually
          intelligible with other related “Neapolitan language” varieties
          throughout Southern Italy.
