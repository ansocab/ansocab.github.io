# My Naples Blog #

This is a draft for a blog about Naples with different sections for content about the culture, restaurant tipps or sightseeing.
I created it to put into practice my newly acquired skills about HTML and CSS.

Here is the link to the website: https://ansocab.github.io/napoli-for-you/
